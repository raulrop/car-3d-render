##  Render a 3D file (.obj) using the Light Weight Java Gaming Library (LWJGL) on the version 3.3.6
### Project done for practice on computer graphics and matrix transformation
The libraries used are Assimp, LWJGL 3.3.6, so it's a very quick execution in order to visualize your model!
(A lots of things to correct, but that's what learning is meant for...)
## How to render?
Feel free to change the loadModel() method:
``` loadModel("your/model/path.obj"); ```
